#' Easy access to myPersonality dataset.
#'
#' \code{myPersonality} package provides tools that make it easy to access data in the large dataset collected and maintained by the Cambridge Psychometrics Centre.

#' @section Register as a collaborator:
#' To gain access to the data, please request access privileges by registering as a collaborator.

#' @section Getting started:
#' Once you have your user name and password, start by running \code{myPersonality()} function.
#' You will be prompted for your user name and password. Once successfully connected, you will see a list of functions for accessing the data (e.g., \code{participants()}.
#' These functions are dynamically created depending on your access rights.
#' The data access functions are self-documenting: by running one without arguments (e.g., \code{participants()}), the function will print additional information about itself.
#' 
#' @section Accessing data:
#' Each data access function allows you to request data from the myPersonality database by listing variable names available through the function.
#' For example, to retrieve age and gender data of all participants in the database, you can type \code{participants("age", "gender")}.
#' To find out which variables are availabe through each function, you can type the function without any arguments.
